Simple Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple neural network from scratch in Python to solve a classification problem for two classes in a 2D space. It demonstrates the basics of neural network implementation without using pre-built libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

This project was created for Artificial Inteligence course i took on Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
